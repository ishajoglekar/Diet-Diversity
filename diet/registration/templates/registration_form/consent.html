                                <p>Dear Parents,
                                    <br> Due to COVID-19, the school education has taken a big turn towards online. Blending online with the activity, project-oriented learning is extremely important. Using some simple activities, using shared devices,
                                    mobiles, and the web is a way to reach out to at least those children who have access to devices and networks. We would like to integrate technology with conventionally used nutrition education programs in such a way
                                    that your child can assess the diet quality of his/her and set a goal to improve it further. We would like an opportunity to educate children about the food diversity, the good practices of past, present, often poor
                                    quality trusted by commercials, impact of dietary lifestyles, connection between health, nutrition and education and best use of communication technology for better living. We request you to enable your child to participate
                                    in our NUTRI-INFOTAINMENT SESSIONS which is a part of a small research project undertaken as a community extension program. For this program, we request interested students to register for the program by filling out
                                    the survey. Registered students will participate in 3 NUTRI-INFOTAINMENT SESSIONS which will be for 1 hour (each) at a convenient time on an e-platform which will have nutrition and health awareness sessions such as:
                                    1. Basic Nutrition, Diet Diversity and communicating the importance of Micro-greens & Nutri- Garden 2. Importance of Health and Immuno-nutrition with a focus on dietary essential fatty acid ratio (omega 3, omega 6)
                                    and total fat content in the diet. 3. JUNCS food consumption, Innovative snack-recipes for children/adolescents and Physical activity patterns. Subject to explicit consent by you the nutrition and BMI parameters of
                                    your child will be stored, and visualized on graph against the background of WHO norms. This will be on the website with restricted access. This will not be published until you so specify. In any case we plan to encrypt
                                    personal information (like name, address etc.) and the same will not be seen un-encrypted on the site. Looking forward to your childâ€™s involvement and your active participation in our effort to communicate a behavioural
                                    change. Any information generated in this program will be used for educational purposes and not published on any social media platform. Thanking you. CTARA TEAM</p>
